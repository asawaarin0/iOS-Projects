SpacePhoto- An app that allows users to view the NASA Astronomy Picture Of The Day for any given day. The NASA APOD API is used to get the picture of the day as well as receive information regarding the image. Sometimes the API returns a video instead of a picture and so the youtube-ios-player-helper library(provided by YouTube) is used to display the youtube video within the app.

Advice - An app that uses a JSON API to fetch a new advice every day to display to the user. The Combine framework is used to facilitate the fetching of the advice and WidgetKit is used to allow users to add Widgets to their home-screen and get the advice at a glance. //TODO: Add MVVM Architecture to the app.

GuessTheFlag- A quiz game app that presents the users with the name of a country and images of 3 different flags. Users have to select the flag matching the country in order to increase their score. The various flag-images are obtained by using the Geognos World Countries API.
