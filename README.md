SpacePhoto- An app that allows users to view the NASA Astronomy Picture Of The Day for any given day. The NASA APOD API is used to get the picture of the day as well as receive information regarding the image. Sometimes the API returns a video instead of a picture and so the youtube-ios-player-helper library(provided by YouTube) is used to display the youtube video within the app.
